# reading, transforming and manipulating FCS files

# Make sure you have Flow Kit installed

# here is the fcs file we will read.
fcs_path = "sampleFCS.fcs"

# read in the FCS file
sample = fk.Sample(fcs_path)

# print to see how many cells and channels there are
# doing so tells us that there are 268796 cells (events) and 49 channels
print(sample)

# convert to numpy array
dm = sample._get_raw_events()

# now we will look at the channel names. This is helpful because we will get comprehensible marker names.
# we will then be only selecting channels corresponding to our marker of interest
CNames = np.array(sample.pns_labels)

# for downstream analysis we will keep the following channels corresponding to phenotypic and functional markers
# you will need to customize this for your own analysis
